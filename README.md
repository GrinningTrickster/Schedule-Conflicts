# Schedule-Conflicts
Identify for each individual whether they have a schedule conflict

## Description
Identify clashes for a set of trainers based on their class schedule. Specifically, the class that 
starts while another class is still busy.

The query pulls back all records that have overlapping datetimes for a 
specific Trainer based on the sample table included. In other words: clashes for each individual trainer, not clashes with another 
trainerâ€™s classes.
